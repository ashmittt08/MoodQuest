# MoodQuest

**AI-Powered Mental Wellness & Gamification Platform** — final-year capstone project.

MoodQuest is a full-stack web app where users check in their mood, talk to a supportive companion, play calming mini-games, follow guided breathing/yoga/mindfulness exercises, keep a private journal, get mood-aware music and movie suggestions, and track their progress over time. A manually accessible emergency page puts helplines and trusted contacts one tap away.

Architecture:

```
React + TypeScript  →  Node.js + Express + TypeScript  →  Prisma ORM  →  PostgreSQL
```

Every screen talks to the real API and every piece of user data is stored in PostgreSQL. The chat companion uses a real LLM through Groq. Facial emotion recognition is not built yet; the camera page has the endpoint ready for it.

## Features

| Screen | What works |
|---|---|
| **Welcome / Auth** | Email + password registration and login (bcrypt + JWT), logout with server-side token revocation, session restore after refresh, protected routes, expired-session handling, rate-limited login. Email is the only sign-in method. |
| **Dashboard** | Time-of-day greeting with the signed-in user's name, six-mood check-in saved to PostgreSQL, current mood card and activity streak computed from real data, "Chat with AI" card with voice input and spoken replies, quick-access grid, notification bell with reminders derived from your check-ins. Emotion Detection is one tap away from the top of the page: a face-scan icon in the header and a "Detect with camera" button next to the mood question. |
| **AI Chat** | Conversations and messages persisted in PostgreSQL; replies are generated **by the backend** with a real LLM through Groq (or built-in keyword replies when no key is configured). History, new/delete conversation, suggested prompts (some open the matching feature), empty-message validation. |
| **Emotion Detection** | Reachable from the Home header, the mood question and directly under Home in the desktop sidebar. Live camera preview via the browser MediaDevices API (start/stop, camera picker, permission errors). A frame can be sent to `POST /api/emotion/analyze`, which answers **501 Not Implemented** because no emotion model is connected yet. No emotion values are invented. |
| **Progress & Analytics** | Mood trend, mood distribution, insights (improvement vs previous period / dominant mood), activity breakdown, recent games and exercises, journal stats, streak calendar; 7/30/90-day ranges; empty states instead of fake history. |
| **Music / Movies** | Mood-aware recommendations from the database ("For You" uses your latest check-in), category tabs, search, featured card; links open YouTube. |
| **Mini Games** | Six playable games — Breathing Flow, Color Match, Memory Challenge, Zen Garden, Stress Burst, Puzzle Mind. Every finished session is stored (`score`, `duration`, `completed_at`). |
| **Meditation & Exercises** | Activities with guided, timed steps; completion is persisted and counts towards streaks and mindful minutes. |
| **Emergency** | Public page (works logged out or offline): SOS with confirmation and `tel:` dialling, trusted contacts stored per user, "Find nearby help" via maps, configurable helpline. No automated detection. |
| **Journal** | Full create / read / update / delete with optional mood tag. |
| **Profile & Settings** | Name, avatar URL, language, timezone (used for streaks/charts), notification preferences, change password, trusted contacts, logout. |

```

- **The API contract is stable.** Routes, payloads and the `{ "detail": "…" }` error format are what the React service layer expects; serializers keep database naming separate from the JSON the frontend sees.
- **Provider interfaces.** `AssistantProvider`, `RecommendationProvider` and `EmotionAnalyzer` are small interfaces. The app ships `GroqAssistant` (with `RuleBasedAssistant` as fallback), `CatalogProvider`, and no emotion analyzer yet; implementations are selected with environment settings.
- **Authorization by ownership.** Every user-owned query filters by `userId`; another user's IDs return 404.
- **Timezone-aware analytics.** Streaks and daily charts are grouped by the user's profile timezone.
- **Catalog seeding.** Games, activities and recommendation records are reference content, seeded idempotently on startup (or with `npm run db:seed`).

## Database schema

Defined in [`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`](backend/prisma/schema.prisma). Models are camelCase in code and map to snake_case tables.

| Model (table) | Fields |
|---|---|
| `User` (`users`) | id, name, email (unique), passwordHash, avatarUrl, createdAt, updatedAt |
| `Profile` (`user_profiles`) | id, userId (unique), preferredLanguage, timezone, notificationPreferences (JSONB) |
| `MoodLog` (`mood_logs`) | id, userId, mood, score (1–5), source (`manual`, reserved: `chat`/`camera`/`voice`), note, createdAt |
| `Conversation` (`conversations`) | id, userId, title, createdAt, updatedAt |
| `Message` (`messages`) | id, conversationId, sender (`user`/`assistant`), content, createdAt |
| `Recommendation` (`recommendations`) | id, userId (NULL = shared catalog), type (`music`/`movie`), category, title, subtitle, description, imageUrl, externalUrl, moods (text[]), isFeatured, provider, externalId, extra (JSONB), createdAt |
| `Game` (`games`) | id, slug, name, description, category, tags (text[]), label, difficulty, durationMinutes, isPlayable |
| `GameSession` (`game_sessions`) | id, userId, gameId, score, duration (s), completedAt |
| `Activity` (`activities`) | id, title, description, category, duration (min), benefit, moods (text[]), mediaUrl, isFeatured, steps (JSONB) |
| `ActivityCompletion` (`activity_completions`) | id, userId, activityId, completedAt |
| `JournalEntry` (`journal_entries`) | id, userId, title, content, mood, createdAt, updatedAt |
| `EmergencyContact` (`emergency_contacts`) | id, userId, name, phone, relationship, isPrimary, createdAt |
| `RevokedToken` (`revoked_tokens`) | id, jti (unique), expiresAt — JWTs invalidated by logout |

All user-owned tables cascade on user deletion.

## Environment variables

`backend/.env` (copy from `backend/.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | API port (default `4000`) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Allowed browser origin(s) for CORS, comma-separated (default `http://localhost:5173`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string, e.g. `postgresql://moodquest:password@localhost:5432/moodquest` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ≥ 32 random characters — `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64url'))"` |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN_MINUTES` | Token lifetime (default 60) |
| `EMERGENCY_NUMBER`, `HELPLINE_NAME`, `HELPLINE_NUMBER`, `HELPLINE_AVAILABILITY` | Emergency page resources — set them for your region |
| `ASSISTANT_PROVIDER` | `groq` (real LLM) or `rule_based` (built-in replies, no key needed) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_MODEL` | Groq key from <https://console.groq.com/keys> and model (default `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Separate database for the test suite (it is wiped between tests) |

The server refuses to start with a clear message if a required variable is missing or invalid.

`frontend/.env` (copy from `frontend/.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | API base URL, default `http://localhost:4000` |

No secrets live in the frontend; all third-party keys (such as `GROQ_API_KEY`) belong in `backend/.env`.

---

## Setup

Prerequisites: **Node.js ≥ 20.19** and **PostgreSQL**.

### 1. Database

```sql
-- in psql or pgAdmin, as a superuser
CREATE USER moodquest WITH PASSWORD 'choose-a-password';
CREATE DATABASE moodquest OWNER moodquest;
CREATE DATABASE moodquest_test OWNER moodquest;   -- only needed for `npm test`
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install                      # also generates the Prisma client
cp .env.example .env             # then fill in DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET (and TEST_DATABASE_URL)
npm run db:migrate               # prisma migrate deploy — creates the tables
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:4000 (auto-reloads)
```

Catalog content (games, activities, recommendations) is seeded automatically on startup; `npm run db:seed` does it manually. Health check: <http://localhost:4000/health>.

Production: `npm run build && npm start`.

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:5173
```

### Useful backend scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the API with auto-reload (tsx) |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Compile to `dist/` / run the compiled server |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations (`prisma migrate deploy`) |
| `npm run db:migrate:dev -- --name <change>` | Create a new migration after editing `schema.prisma` |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed catalog content |
| `npm test` | Run API tests against `TEST_DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run the tests that need no database (Groq provider with a mocked API) |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check |

| GET | `/api/emergency/resources` | Emergency number + helplines (public) |
| GET | `/health` | API + database health |

Errors always use `{ "detail": "<human-readable message>" }` (validation errors add an `errors` list). Stack traces are never returned; a database outage returns `503`.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Backend — Vitest + Supertest against a real PostgreSQL test database
cd backend
npm test

# Frontend — Vitest + Testing Library
cd frontend
npm test
```

The backend suite migrates `TEST_DATABASE_URL` automatically, truncates all tables before each test, and refuses to run if `TEST_DATABASE_URL` equals `DATABASE_URL`. It covers registration, login, password hashing, JWT validation (invalid, forged, expired, revoked, deleted user), every protected route, profile & password change, emergency contacts, mood creation/listing/validation/privacy, mood statistics (trend, distribution, streaks, insights), conversations & messages, journal CRUD & authorization, games & sessions, activities & completions, recommendations (personalisation, categories, search), the emotion placeholder (501 / 415 / 401), emergency resources, health, CORS and JSON error handling.

Frontend coverage: anonymous redirect, login validation & server errors, login → dashboard with the user's name, returning to the requested page after login, session restore, expired-session handling, registration validation, mood check-in through the API, active bottom-nav state, Progress empty state, chat validation and send/receive, chat empty state, safe error messages.

---

## Future work

| Capability | Where it plugs in |
|---|---|
| LLM companion | **Done with Groq** (`GroqAssistant`). To use another model or provider, implement `AssistantProvider` in `backend/src/services/assistant.service.ts` and select it with `ASSISTANT_PROVIDER`. |
| Facial emotion recognition (OpenCV + FER2013 CNN / DeepFace) | Implement `EmotionAnalyzer` in `services/emotion.service.ts` — e.g. call a small Python model service over HTTP. `/api/emotion/analyze` already validates and receives frames from the camera page; results can be stored as `MoodLog` rows with `source = "camera"`. |
| Voice (Whisper / ElevenLabs) | Chat mic & call buttons are in place; add an audio endpoint and store transcripts as messages. |
| Mood fusion | Combine `MoodLog` rows from `manual`, `chat`, `camera` and `voice` sources. |
| Spotify / TMDB | Implement `RecommendationProvider` per type in `services/recommendation.service.ts`; store results as `Recommendation` rows with `provider`, `externalId` and optional `userId`. Keys stay server-side. |
| Crisis support | A properly evaluated classifier and escalation flow; emergency contacts are already stored per user. |

---

## Known limitations

- **The chat companion is a general-purpose LLM** (Groq) guided by a supportive system prompt; it can make mistakes and is not a therapist. Explicit self-harm phrases are intercepted by a keyword check that returns the configured helpline message instead of calling the model — this is **not** a risk classifier and triggers no notifications. If Groq is unreachable, replies fall back to the built-in keyword responses.
- Chat messages are sent to Groq to generate replies; mention this in your privacy notes.
- **No emotion detection yet.** The camera preview works; analysis returns 501 until a model is connected.
- **Recommendation artwork** is generated per title (SVG scenes) because no licensed images are bundled; links open YouTube searches until Spotify/TMDB integration.
- **Notification preferences are stored** but push/email delivery is not implemented; reminders appear in the in-app bell.
- JWTs are kept in `localStorage` for simplicity; an httpOnly-cookie session would be stronger against XSS.
- Passwords use `bcryptjs` (a pure-JavaScript bcrypt implementation, standard `$2b$` hashes, cost 12) to avoid native build issues on Windows.
- Helpline numbers are configuration — verify them for your region before deployment.
- MoodQuest is a wellness tool, **not a medical or crisis service**.
